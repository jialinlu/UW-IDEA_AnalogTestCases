A 9-bit Resistor-based DLPF-based SAR quantization embedded Thermal Sensor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sensor is for on-chip thermal detection. It uses differential low pass filter (DLPF) as the sensing
elements. While the readout circuit is a SAR ADC. The CDAC was embedded in the DLPF, which can
eliminate CDAC reference circuits and utilize the ADC whole dynamic range. The design was
implemented in a 65nm CMOS process.
