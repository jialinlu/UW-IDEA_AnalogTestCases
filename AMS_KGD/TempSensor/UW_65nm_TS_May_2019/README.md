A 9-bit Resistor-based Thermal Sensor with SAR Embedded Quantization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file fold includes a resistor-based area-compact temperature sensor for on-chip thermal detection. It has three unique features: 
1) the use of a differential low-pass RC filter (DLPF) for thermal sensing, which reduces the area; 
2) successive approximation register (SAR)-quantization embedded in the DLPF, which reuses the DLPF capacitor for capacitive digital-to-analog conversion (CDAC), eliminates the CDAC references, and utilizes the full sensing range for quantization; 
and 3) a highly digital circuit architecture, which can be easily implemented using a standard digital design flow and migrated to different processes. 
The temperature sensor was desigend in a 65-nm CMOS technology. 


The testbench to test the output digits versus temperature is included in the fold Testbench.
